            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">At Pepeha Generator, protecting your privacy is of utmost importance to us. We are fully committed to ensuring that your personal data is handled with care, and any information collected through your interaction with our platform will be treated with confidentiality. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have regarding your data.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The Pepeha Generator only collects information that you voluntarily provide, such as your name, home location, family names, and other details you include when completing your Pepeha. None of this information is stored on our servers, and we do not collect information without your consent.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>Your Pepeha data is generated solely based on the provided inputs, and is not stored permanently on our servers.</li>
                <li>We do not share, sell, or distribute any of your personal data to third parties for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose.</li>
                <li>All information input into the Pepeha Generator is processed internally and is used only for session-based generation purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Data Security</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We have implemented robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, and misuse of your information. All information is processed within the system's internal mechanisms and is not exposed to third parties. Our security efforts aim to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your inputs.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Data Retention</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We do not retain your data. Once the Pepeha is generated, the inputs are discarded immediately, ensuring that your information is not stored on our servers beyond the immediate generation session.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">AI Usage and Data Handling</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">This website utilises artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately translate from English place names to Maori place names, as well as generate personalized Pepehas. However, we want to assure you that:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>The data used to train the AI model is not derived from your interactions with this website.</li>
                <li>Each time you generate a Pepeha, the AI processes your input in real-time and discards the data immediately after generating the result.</li>
                <li>None of your personal information is retained or used to improve the AI model.</li>
                <li>By using this service, you consent to the temporary processing of your input data for the sole purpose of generating your Pepeha.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">API Requests and Security</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">For secure API requests, we utilize Groq's services. Their privacy policy and terms of service apply to all data transmitted through their platform. You can find more information at:</p>

            <p class="mb-4">As a user, you have the right to access the information you provide during the session. Since no data is stored, you are in full control of the inputs you provide, and nothing is permanently associated with your usage of our generator.</p>
