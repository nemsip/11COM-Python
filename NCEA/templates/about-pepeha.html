                <p class="mt-2">Pepeha, or "who am I?", is a fundamental concept in Māori culture that dates back to ancient times. It's a way of introducing oneself and connecting with others, rooted deeply in Māori philosophy and worldview.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-medium text-white">Impact of Colonisation</h3>

Many Māori were forced to adapt their traditional practices to fit European norms. However, pepeha continued to play a vital role in maintaining Māori identity and connection to their heritage.</p>
