                <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">In a pepeha, you typically mention your name, your family name, your ancestral mountain, river, and other significant landmarks that hold cultural importance to you.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">By sharing your pepeha, you honor your heritage and contribute to the preservation of Māori culture.</p>
